          <h2>Father of Pakistan's Atomic Bomb</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan</b>, often referred to as the father of
            Pakistan's nuclear program, is a renowned scientist and national
            hero. Born in 1936 in Bhopal, India, Khan's contributions to
            Pakistan's defense capabilities have left an indelible mark on the
            country's history. Educated in Europe and Canada, Khan returned to
            Pakistan in the 1970s and spearheaded the development of Pakistan's
            nuclear weapons program. His pivotal role in achieving nuclear
            capability made him a celebrated figure among Pakistanis, earning
            him both admiration and controversy. Despite facing international
            scrutiny and sanctions, Khan remained steadfast in his dedication to
            Pakistan's security interests. However, his later years were mired
            in controversy due to allegations of nuclear proliferation.
            Regardless of the controversies surrounding his legacy, Dr. Abdul
            Qadeer Khan's contributions to Pakistan's scientific advancement and
            national defense remain significant and continue to shape the
            country's identity on the global stage.
